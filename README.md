# fantasy grounds extensions

Intended as a collection of the extensions I make for fantasy grounds

In order to use any of these extensions, they need to be placed into the extensions folder for fantasy grounds:

`<DISK>:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\SmiteWorks\Fantasy Grounds\extensions`

It will then be available for selection when setting up the campaign server

## True Expressions

True expressions is intended to improving expression calculation by reading character data as real numbers.

In order to use this, some parts are required:

When defining the action effect in the character sheet, you must define which character the data will be collected from. This is done by adding `[NAME|Character name]` in the expression with everything else.

Supported values that can be collected are:

* [LVL]
* [STR]
* [DEX]
* [CON]
* [INT]
* [WIS]
* [CHA]

An example:
`Heavy Attack; ATK: 1 + [CON]; [NAME|Character Name]`

Arithmetic tools are also available

* min(x, y)
* max(x, y)
* mul(x, y)
* div(x, y)
* cos(x)
* floor(x)
* ceil(x)

Example:
`Arcane Strike; ATK: 1 + div([LVL],4); [NAME|Character Name]`

Please note that no calculus will be perfomed unless the modifier is numerical or rollable

Numerical calculations will preroll dice, while rollable calculations will leave this to Fantasy Grounds
